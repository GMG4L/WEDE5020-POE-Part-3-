        To issue our services is very easy, you either sign up with your ID and home address or book our free services online at LaundryHub.org.
        Once ordered, we will issue you a pickup date based on your neighborhood (Area Code).
        Clothes will be returned on specific dates, or you may come to collect them live.
        This process ensures that clothes are not lost or stolen. Our services are applicable to residents who earn lower than R5000 and are part of the working force of South Africa.
